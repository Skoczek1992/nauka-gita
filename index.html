				<p class="text">I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
					See Marshall no more, they want Shady - I'm chopped liver
					Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
					A little bit of weed mixed with some hardliquor
					<br></br>
					Some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker then a
					Shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating
					When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (YEAH!)
					<br></br>
					You waited this long now stop debating, 'cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
					I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney but your husband's heart problem's complicating
					So the FCC wont let me be or let me be me so let me see
					<br></br>
					They tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me
					So come on and dip, bum on your lips, fuck that 
					Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
					I just settled all my lawsuits
					SO FUCK YOU DEBBIE!
